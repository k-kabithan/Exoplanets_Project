The exoplanet dataset contains information on planets outside of our solar system. The data includes, the year of discovery, detection method, mass and radius based on Jupiter and Earth, and other various properties. The dataset was used to explore the distribution of exoplanets by detection method and year of discovery. Visualisations were created to show what type of exoplanets have the potential to support life based on their mass and radius, the type of exoplanets discovered by detection method, and the number of exoplanets discovered every year between 1992-2022. The insights gained from the dataset can be used for further research and discovery in the field of astronomy.
